Hi, I'm Bo! Welcome to my digital garden üå∑

I'm currently a Computer Science student at McGill University (but also minoring in Economics). I'm working as a Software Engineer at the moment but in past lives I was in marketing, growth, and product management. I believe the media we consume is a pretty good represenative of who we are, so here's what I'm [reading](https://curius.app/bo-lau) on the internet. 

Right now: 
- Interning at MaintainX as a Full Stack Dev (I ‚ù§Ô∏è Typescript)
- Teaching myself how to DJ 
- Trying to write more and express my thoughts more openly! See [third time's the charm](thirdyear.md)
- Dilly dallying to different cafes and mapping them
