Hi, I'm Bo! Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ·

I'm currently a Computer Science student at McGill University (but also minoring in Economics). I'm working as a Software Engineer at the moment but in past lives I was in marketing, growth, and product management. 

Here's what I'm [reading](https://curius.app/bo-lau) on the internet. 

Right now: 
- Interning at MaintainX as a Full Stack Dev 
- Teaching myself how to DJ 
- Trying out different cafes and mapping them
